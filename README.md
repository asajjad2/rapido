Hey, This is Areeb Sajjad!

This project is the first of many in the journey of learning front-end development. 
It was given to me under the IEC web development bootcamp and consists of a static website about a topic of our own choosing.
Markup done using pure HTML5 in 3 .html files & their styling using CSS3 in a single file.

The process of making the website consisted of thinking for an idea, its use cases, looking for web on design inspiration, coding the wireframe and then filling on content.

Design inspiration taken from https://www.behance.net
Keeping a consistent color theme using https://coolors.co/

This is a website for an imaginary fast-food chain & consists of the following sections:

1. The main page starts with a navigation bar providing the ability to jump to the desired section using <a> tags.
2. This is followed by a section introducing a new burger - I use css ability to style text with fontsize, fontfamily, fontshadow properties.
3. A brief introduction section where I use fonts taken from google font services. I have also added and styles a button at the end of the section.
4. The Menu Section. Here I've used a background image to provide lively, fast-food restaurant colors. On top of this background I've displayed the menu on a opaque    div. I've made use of CSS flexbox here to manage the menu entries. I've also put in icons using services from https://fontawesome.com/.
5. The deals section where I've built a static carousel using pure CSS.
6. The "Meal" section to add onto the user's order. Here I've added a button to be clicked when the user has completed his/her order and wants to check out. This      button takes the user to the payments page.
7. The payment page mainly consists of an HTML form which is linked to formspree.io. It also contains an order summary component.
8. On the payment page the user is given an option to Sign-in to an account where we could store the user's order history and offer discounts based on that (to be      implemented). For now, the option takes the user to another page where I've built another signIn / SignUp form.
9. The last component is the footer of the website which mostly uses the same flexbox styling rules used in the navbar.
  
The current version of the website can be accessed at https://asajjad2.github.io/rapido/index.html
  
Ideas for future improvement:
  
  - Provide functionality to the deals carousel using JavaScript.
  - Use the sign in menu to provide custom features to customers (greeting, discounts etc.)
  - Improve design choices through professional advice.
  - Add a Cart Section where the user can see their order and not just the total payment.
  - Provide options for add-ons during the payment phase.
  - Use google maps API to show the location of stores.
